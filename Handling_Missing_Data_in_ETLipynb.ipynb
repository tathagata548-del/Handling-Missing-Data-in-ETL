        "\n",
        "1.Source System Issues\n",
        "\n",
        "Data was never captured in the source (optional fields, user skipped input).\n",
        "\n",
        "Manual entry errors (blank fields, incomplete forms).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Data Extraction Failures\n",
        "\n",
        "Connection issues (API timeout, DB connection drop).\n",

        "Incremental load logic missed records (wrong date filter, wrong key).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Schema Changes in Source\n",
        "\n",
        "Source system adds/removes/renames columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "ETL job still expects the old schema → data becomes NULL or ignored.\n",

        "Ans:The blindly deleting rows with missing values considered a bad practice in ETL are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Data Loss\n",
        "\n",
        "You may delete valuable and valid records.\n",

        "4.Business Impact\n",
        "\n",
        "Missing data might be meaningful (e.g., NULL salary = not disclosed).\n",
        "\n",
        "Deleting such rows can misrepresent business rules.\n",

        "Listwise deletion\n",

        "Meaning\tDeletes the entire row if any column has a missing value\tDeletes the entire column if it has many missing values\n",

        "Data loss\tHigh (row-level data lost)\tAttribute-level data loss\n",
        "Bias risk\tHigh\tLower\n",
        "Impact on dataset\tReduces number of records\tReduces number of features\n",
        "Appropriate scenario\tWhen strict completeness is required and missing data is very small (e.g., financial or regulatory reports)\tWhen a column has very high missing % and low business importance (e.g., fax number)\n",
        "ETL usage\tRare in production pipelines\tSometimes used\n",
        "Example\tRemoving records with any NULL in a compliance dataset\tDropping a legacy or unused column\n",
        "Q4. Why is median imputation preferred over mean imputation for skewed data such as income?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:The median imputation preferred over mean imputation for skewed data such as income are\n",
        "\n",
        "Reason\tExplanation\n",
        "Robust to outliers\tIncome data usually has extreme high values. The mean gets pulled up, but the median stays stable.\n",
        "Represents typical value\tThe median reflects the central tendency of skewed data better than the mean.\n",
        "Reduces distortion\tMean imputation can inflate or deflate values unrealistically in skewed distributions.\n",
        "Preserves distribution shape\tMedian imputation keeps the original skewness more intact.\n",
        "Better business sense\tMost people earn around the median income, not the average influenced by top earners.\n",
        "Q5. What is forward fill and in what type of dataset is it most useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Forward fill means replacing a missing value with the last available (previous) non-missing value in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Typical datasets include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Stock prices\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:We should flagging missing values be done before imputation in an ETL workflow are\n",
        "\n",
        "Reason\tExplanation\n",
        "Preserves original information\tFlagging keeps a record of which values were originally missing before they were filled.\n",
        "Enables better analysis\tAnalysts and models can treat imputed values differently from real values.\n",
        "Improves transparency\tMakes the ETL process auditable and explainable.\n",
        "Helps detect data quality issues\tHigh flags indicate upstream source problems.\n",
        "Prevents misleading insights\tImputed values look real unless flagged, which can bias reports and models.\n",
        "Supports future reprocessing\tRaw missingness info allows re-imputation with better methods later.\n",
        "Q7. Consider a scenario where income is missing for many customers. How can this missingness itself provide busi\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Missing income data can itself be informative and not just a data quality issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "Business insights from missing income:\n",
        "\n",
        "Customers with missing income may belong to informal sectors, freelancers, students, or unemployed groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "They might be less willing to disclose financial details, indicating privacy concerns or low trust.\n",
        "\n",
        "Missing income could correlate with lower creditworthiness, higher risk, or different spending behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "In some cases, high-net-worth customers also skip income fields, assuming it’s irrelevant, which signals a premium segment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The pattern of missing income across regions, age groups, or products can help businesses refine targeting, pricing, and risk models.\n",
